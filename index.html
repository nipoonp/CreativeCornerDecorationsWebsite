			<li>To bust the first myth, a wedding planner does NOT need to be expensive - you can get our support for as little as $600!</li>
			<li>We can tailor make a package to suit your needs and budget by helping just a little, or a lot</li>
			<li>The Queen package is the full wedding planning suite, where pink apple covers every detail of the preparation, planning and execution leaving you with a completely stress free wedding - pure bliss.</li>
			<li>The Dame package is our most cost effective and with this package we come in a month before the wedding to manage and coordinate all your suppliers/vendors. We confirm all your vendors are delivering according to their contracts, remove the pre-wedding stress and make sure everything has been checked (and rechecked) and nothing has been missed. We will be present on the day to execute your wedding </li>
			<li>Our Princess and Duchess packages offer varying levels of our involvement between the two above</li>
			<li>As well as organising the wedding, we hire out awesome wedding decor - and can deliver, set-up and pack-down too.</li>

				<p><h4>Katherine Torres, bride (March 2018) </h4>We were very lucky to have Heather organise our beautiful wedding at such short notice - it would not have been possible without her. She was so organised, reliable and executed our vision for the day perfectly. She was so easy to work with, efficient and knowledgeable. She created the most amazing day for us, it was like a dream. We highly recommend Heather and we can't thank her enough! </p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
				<p><h4>Angie Curtis, Treasuring Hearts Photography </h4>I worked with Heather in January 2017, and I was so impressed with how organised she was, especially seeing that the couple was planning their wedding all the way from the UK, and I am based in Wellington! She planned everything meticulously, with her own touch of style, keeping us all in the loop ever step of the way. Your day is her day too...she takes the journey with you. â™¥</p>

			<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
				<p><h4>Mike Steffens, DJ (August 2017) </h4>I worked with Heather earlier this year and she brought together the wedding at Allely House perfectly. She worked tremendously hard in the background creating a wonderful celebration of love with family and friends. She was a pleasure to work with and I would highly recommend her to any bride or venue looking to have a flawless wedding day.</p>

			<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
				<p><h4>Rachel Lewis, business owner (November 2017) </h4>We used Pink Apple to help us plan and run the end of year Christmas event for our community of women in business. Heather was amazing and went over and above the call of duty to plan out the evening, help us decorate and then ensure the smooth running of the night. I was able to relax and mingle knowing that Heather had everything covered and was so grateful for her calm help. I was also tricky to pin down prior to the event so Heather ran with this largely on her own and did a wonderful job! Highly recommend, thank you so much Heather!</p>

				<h4> We LOVE planning parties and weddings!!!!</h4>
				<p>For the last 20 years I have been the trusted party planner for friends and family - and I have loved every event. I have arranged baby showers, christenings, hen parties, birthdays, holidays etc! The more I planned, the more I realised how much I loved the job and wanted to make it my career.</p>
				<p>I was married in Auckland in January 2017 and planned the wedding myself while living in the UK and holding down a demanding job. Following our wedding, I was addicted to the country as well as the role of wedding planning. So hence the career path started and I decided to make my dream job a reality....</p>
