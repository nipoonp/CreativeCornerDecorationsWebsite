			<h4> We LOVE planning parties and weddings!!!!</h4>
			<p>For the last 20 years I have been the trusted party planner for friends and family - and I have loved every event. I have arranged baby showers, christenings, hen parties, birthdays, holidays etc! The more I planned, the more I realised how much I loved the job and wanted to make it my career.</p>
			<p>I was married in Auckland in January 2017 and planned the wedding myself while living in the UK and holding down a demanding job. Following our wedding, I was addicted to the country as well as the role of wedding planning. So hence the career path started and I decided to make my dream job a reality....</p>
