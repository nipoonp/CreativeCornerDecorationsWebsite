	There's something truly magical about the collection of details that pulls an event together and to be trusted with that special occasion is incredibly gratifying. Envy Events came from a need to create and was built on absolute passion and love, with every day that passion only grows. I can honestly say that there is nowhere else I'd rather be. I still immerse myself in every event as though it's the first, I still stand back in awe with what we have created and I still feel that heart bursting pride when you call and tell me that it couldn't have been more perfect.

	We are a small boutique team and our service reflects that.  We recognise that each event is unique and take pride in providing a service that is completely personalised.   We don't do "cookie cutter" here and our aim is always to exceed expectations, we can proudly say that we have accomplished that so far.

	I hope you enjoy looking through the work my team and I have created and I would love to hear from you to personally discuss your special event.
