		<li>To bust the first myth, a wedding planner does NOT need to be expensive - you can get our support for as little as $600!</li>
		<li>We can tailor make a package to suit your needs and budget by helping just a little, or a lot</li>
		<li>The Queen package is the full wedding planning suite, where pink apple covers every detail of the preparation, planning and execution leaving you with a completely stress free wedding - pure bliss.</li>
		<li>The Dame package is our most cost effective and with this package we come in a month before the wedding to manage and coordinate all your suppliers/vendors. We confirm all your vendors are delivering according to their contracts, remove the pre-wedding stress and make sure everything has been checked (and rechecked) and nothing has been missed. We will be present on the day to execute your wedding </li>
		<li>Our Princess and Duchess packages offer varying levels of our involvement between the two above</li>
		<li>As well as organising the wedding, we hire out awesome wedding decor - and can deliver, set-up and pack-down too.</li>
		<li>As every wedding is different, get in touch today for a complimentary meeting to discuss your specific requirements and how we can add sparkle to your wedding </li>
