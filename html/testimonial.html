			<p><h4>Katherine Torres, bride (March 2018) </h4>We were very lucky to have Heather organise our beautiful wedding at such short notice - it would not have been possible without her. She was so organised, reliable and executed our vision for the day perfectly. She was so easy to work with, efficient and knowledgeable. She created the most amazing day for us, it was like a dream. We highly recommend Heather and we can't thank her enough! </p>

			<p><h4>Angie Curtis, Treasuring Hearts Photography </h4>I worked with Heather in January 2017, and I was so impressed with how organised she was, especially seeing that the couple was planning their wedding all the way from the UK, and I am based in Wellington! She planned everything meticulously, with her own touch of style, keeping us all in the loop ever step of the way. Your day is her day too...she takes the journey with you. â™¥</p>

			<p><h4>Mike Steffens, DJ (August 2017) </h4>I worked with Heather earlier this year and she brought together the wedding at Allely House perfectly. She worked tremendously hard in the background creating a wonderful celebration of love with family and friends. She was a pleasure to work with and I would highly recommend her to any bride or venue looking to have a flawless wedding day.</p>

			<p><h4>Rachel Lewis, business owner (November 2017) </h4>We used Pink Apple to help us plan and run the end of year Christmas event for our community of women in business. Heather was amazing and went over and above the call of duty to plan out the evening, help us decorate and then ensure the smooth running of the night. I was able to relax and mingle knowing that Heather had everything covered and was so grateful for her calm help. I was also tricky to pin down prior to the event so Heather ran with this largely on her own and did a wonderful job! Highly recommend, thank you so much Heather!</p>
